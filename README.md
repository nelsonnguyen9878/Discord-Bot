# Discord-Bot

The point of this discord bot is to allow me to practice my javascript skills and build something that multiple discord server could use.
The bot interacts with external API's to fetch real time data

Features ---------------
- /weather <city> # gives the weather of whatever city
- weather forecast that displays in a text channel for today and tomorrow's weather.
- Welcome message for anyone that joins into the server
